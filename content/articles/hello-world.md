# Hello, World!
 Taking notes is part of my learning process. So, I decided to make some of these notes and observations public.

## Why?

One of the things I have always done when learning something new is to share what I've learned and take notes on this information for later use. When I was 17 years old, I was already teaching the basics of computers, and finding ways to make this subject interesting with practical examples was a daily challenge.

Later, when I started working with computer programming, I realized that I needed to stay updated, conduct constant research, and even regularly propose new ideas. I also love to have conversations and explain things, which often led to long discussions with my college peers.

Ultimately, what I really wanted to do was gather everything I had learned over time in one place. This would not only serve as a personal record for me but also as a source of information for others who had the same questions and interests as me. In this way, everyone could benefit from what I had learned.

## How?

This project went through various technologies before finding something that really pleased me and was easy to use. To achieve this goal, I looked for frameworks that worked with SSG (Static Site Generator) to avoid setting up database environments and the like. Since the idea was to create a blog with articles, the use of Markdown-format files was chosen.

Initially, I tried to use tools like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which are based on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). However, since I've never been a big fan of React and have always had familiarity with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), I ended up migrating the project to [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). It's worth noting that my choice wasn't based on technical considerations like performance or anything like that, but rather on my personal preference: I like VueJS, and I opted for Nuxt because it offered what I needed.

When using Nuxt, I had the option to start the project with an initial template called [Alpine](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/alpine-starter/tree/main), which I chose for this blog.

As for hosting, I opted for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which allows seamless integration with GitHub. This means that every time I make a change and push it to GitHub, Netlify automatically initiates the deployment process, publishing the changes.

One of the key lessons I learned from this whole process is the importance of starting simple, using only what is truly necessary. Furthermore, there's no harm in leveraging ready-made resources, such as a template or initial project, both at the beginning and throughout development. After all, the main goal here is simply to record the most important information, not to create a commercial blog or website.
